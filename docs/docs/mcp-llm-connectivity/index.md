# MCP-LLM Connectivity Patterns

This section explores real-world connectivity patterns between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations. These diagrams illustrate various architectural approaches, integration strategies, and communication flows used in production AI systems.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) serves as a standardized communication layer between LLMs and external tools, services, and data sources. These patterns demonstrate how organizations implement scalable, secure, and efficient AI systems using MCP.

## Connectivity Pattern Categories

### 1. Basic Communication Flows
- **[Basic MCP-LLM Flow](basic-flow.md)**: Simple request-response patterns
- **[Tool Integration](tool-integration.md)**: External tool connectivity via MCP

### 2. Multi-Agent Systems
- **[Multi-Agent Architecture](multi-agent.md)**: Collaborative AI agent networks
- **[Agent Orchestration](agent-orchestration.md)**: Coordinated agent workflows

### 3. Enterprise Architectures
- **[Enterprise Integration](enterprise-architecture.md)**: Large-scale organizational implementations
- **[Security Patterns](security-patterns.md)**: Authentication and authorization flows

### 4. Advanced Patterns
- **[Real-Time Streaming](real-time-streaming.md)**: Live data processing and streaming
- **[Scaling Patterns](scaling-patterns.md)**: Load balancing and horizontal scaling
- **[Data Flow Patterns](data-flow.md)**: Complex data persistence and retrieval

## Use Cases Covered

- **Customer Service Automation**: AI agents handling support tickets with database access
